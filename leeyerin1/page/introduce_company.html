              <span>W</span>hen we started, doubt was the only thing that was certain. And whilst everyone was doubtful, my personal doubt was perhaps the strongest. We knew we wanted to change all things in the world of beauty. Everyone's guidance was that "you
              can't do 10 things at once". And so we did what was the right thing to do. We decided to do 10 things at once and called our craziness DECIEM, coming from decima, the latin word for 10 in a sequence. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
              elit. Minus rerum voluptatem porro explicabo dolorum nobis quas ducimus, ut numquam tempore! Sint consectetur earum ad perferendis magni provident inventore ipsa dicta.</p>

              <span>I</span> have now learnt there's merit in the advice of doing one thing at a time, but I also know that I and we could not be happier today. The wrong thing to do was the right thing for us. By focusing on many brands in many segments, our team
              is always alive and excited. None of our brands on their own could afford to have its own dedicated laboratory, production facility, creative team, distribution offices and complex backend systems, but combined together, they can each afford
              their timeshare of our incredible team and resources. By doing <strong>"10 things"</strong>, we are actually doing more for each and every one of our brands on their own. Building a brand is difficult. It's like building trust. I have been fortunate
              to experience both success and failure in creating brands across industries as diverse as technology and cosmetics, and along this path, I have identified my passion for creating authentic brands and guarding their growth like a benevolent parent.</p>

              <span>D</span>ECIEM is an output for this insatiable intrigue toward creating brands that change what life seems to offer at least in the world of beauty. DECIEM exists to create beauty brands with one mission common amongst them: to marry function,
              design and authenticity. We believe strongly that, if we are unforgiving to every detail, there will always be those few who will recognize this dedication. In June 2017, we entered into a family-like partnership with The Estée Lauder Companies
              so that we can do more of what we do. Please take a moment to read my open letter about this very special partnership here. We are working hard. Our plate is very full. Yet somehow, despite all odds, despite all advice, we believe we can do
              even more. And I am grateful for this impractical-seeming desire that drives us and the peace we find in this pace.</p>
